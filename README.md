# Toy-SMC
Play a bit around based on Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez 2004 ([here](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/ejemplo.pdf)). 
I'm not sure about <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(v^{t|t-1,i})">. Is this the same as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(v^{t,i}|x^{t|t-1,i})">? And why has my liklihood function extremely small values?
